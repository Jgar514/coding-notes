### Inventory Update
#### The Problem
Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.

```javascript
function updateInventory(arr1, arr2) {
    return arr1;
}

// Example inventory lists
var curInv = [
    [21, "Bowling Ball"],
    [2, "Dirty Sock"],
    [1, "Hair Pin"],
    [5, "Microphone"]
];

var newInv = [
    [2, "Hair Pin"],
    [3, "Half-Eaten Apple"],
    [67, "Bowling Ball"],
    [7, "Toothpaste"]
];

updateInventory(curInv, newInv);
```
#### Solving

Step 1️⃣: Understand the Problem
- What are the inputs and outputs
  - Input:
arr1: A 2D array representing the current inventory (each element is [quantity, itemName]).
  - arr2: A 2D array representing the new inventory to be added (same format).
  - Output:
A 2D array with the updated inventory, sorted alphabetically by item name.
- Are there constraints or edge cases to consider?
  - What if arr1 is empty? (New inventory becomes the updated inventory.)
   - What if an item has a quantity of 0? (Should it be removed?)
   - What if all items in arr2 are already in arr1? (Just update quantities.)
   - What if arr2 is empty? (Return arr1 as is.)
   - What if items in arr2 have different letter cases? (Case sensitivity?)
