# Career Terms

## Cyber Range Training
  ### Cyber Range: 
  - A controlled, virtual environment where cybersecurity professionals can practice responding to cyber threats, test security tools, and refine their skills.
- Training Test Cases: These are specific situations or challenges designed to test security skills, such as detecting and mitigating cyber threats.
- Scenarios: Realistic cyberattack simulations (e.g., phishing campaigns, malware infections, network breaches) to train individuals or teams in incident response.
- Procedures: The step-by-step guidelines and protocols for handling different security events within the cyber range.
- Software Applications and Tools: These could include SIEM tools (Splunk, ELK), vulnerability scanners (Nessus, Qualys), forensic tools (Autopsy, Wireshark), or security automation platforms.
  
Essentially, this means you'd be helping to design realistic cybersecurity exercises that train professionals in detecting, analyzing, and responding to cyber threats. It requires both technical knowledge of security tools and the creativity to craft engaging and effective training simulations.

## Big Data Technologies
### MapReduce
- A programming model for processing large datasets in parallel across multiple machines.
- Used to split, process, and aggregate data efficiently.
- Works in two steps:
  - Map: Distributes the data and processes it in chunks.
  - Reduce: Aggregates the processed data into meaningful results.
- Originally developed by Google and implemented in Hadoop.
### Hadoop
- An open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of big data.
- Uses HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) to store massive amounts of data.
- Can run MapReduce jobs to process data in parallel.
- Commonly used in data analytics, cybersecurity (e.g., log analysis), and cloud computing.
### Accumulo
- A NoSQL distributed database built on top of Hadoop.
- Developed by the NSA for handling massive amounts of structured and unstructured data securely.
- Supports cell-level security, allowing fine-grained access control to data.
- Used in government, intelligence, and large-scale data processing.

## Business Intelligence

Business Intelligence (BI) is the process of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing data to help organizations make informed decisions. It involves tools, technologies, and methodologies for transforming raw data into meaningful insights through reports, dashboards, and analytics. BI helps businesses improve efficiency, identify trends, and drive strategic decision-making. 

## C2C 
Corp-to-Corp (C2C) means that you own or work under a corporation (LLC, S-Corp, etc.) and will be contracting your services through your company instead of being a W-2 employee or 1099 independent contractor.
  - account for taxes, inurance, etc.
    - Self-Employment Taxes (15.3%)   - Covers Social Security (12.4%) & Medicare (2.9%), which employers usually split with W-2 employees.
    - No Benefits ‚Äì You must cover health insurance, retirement contributions, and paid time off.
    - Unpaid Taxes ‚Äì Unlike W-2, no employer withholds taxes, so you must pay quarterly estimated taxes.
    
  ### **C2C vs. 1099: What's the Difference?**  

Both **C2C (Corp-to-Corp)** and **1099 (Independent Contractor)** are ways to work as a self-employed individual, but they have different legal, tax, and business implications.  

| Feature | **C2C (Corp-to-Corp)** | **1099 (Independent Contractor)** |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Who You Are** | A **business entity (LLC/S-Corp)** contracting with another company | A **self-employed individual** working directly with a client |
| **How You Get Paid** | Your **business (LLC/S-Corp)** gets paid, not you personally | You get paid **directly as an individual** |
| **Taxes** | - No self-employment tax (just payroll tax if you take salary)  <br> - Must file **business taxes** <br> - Responsible for **quarterly estimated taxes** | - Pays **self-employment tax (15.3%)** <br> - Responsible for **quarterly estimated taxes** <br> - No separate business tax filing |
| **Legal Protection** | More legal protection since liability is on the **business, not you** | **You are personally liable** for any issues or lawsuits |
| **Retirement Benefits** | Can set up **Solo 401(k)** or **SEP IRA** with higher contribution limits | Can set up **Solo 401(k) or SEP IRA**, but contributions might be lower |
| **Health Insurance** | Must get your own health insurance | Must get your own health insurance |
| **Ease of Setup** | Requires setting up **LLC or S-Corp** (cost & paperwork involved) | No setup needed‚Äîjust start working and file **Schedule C** on taxes |
| **Common Use Cases** | Used when working with **agencies, staffing firms, or large corporations** that only contract with registered businesses | Used when working **directly with clients or smaller companies** that hire freelancers |
| **Example Scenario** | You have an **LLC** and sign a contract with a staffing agency for a React developer role. The agency pays your **business entity**, and you take a salary from it. | A startup hires you as a **freelance React developer** and pays you **directly**. You report earnings on a **1099-NEC** form. |


### **Which Is Better?**
‚úÖ **C2C (Corp-to-Corp) is better if:**
- You **already have an LLC/S-Corp** or are willing to set one up  
- You want **legal protection** (separate personal & business liability)  
- You want **more tax deductions and control over payroll taxes**  
- You work with **agencies or companies that prefer dealing with businesses**  

‚úÖ **1099 (Independent Contractor) is better if:**
- You **don't want the hassle** of setting up and maintaining an LLC  
- You prefer a **simple tax process** (report income on **Schedule C**)  
- You're **working directly with clients**, not through an agency  

## Enterprise Development 
  - bigger scale, supports more users
  - modular, multiple teams
